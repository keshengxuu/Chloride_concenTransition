## Chloride_concenTransition model

The MATLAB implementation of model of chloride concentration in modulating seizure transitions was modified from the model developed by Jyun-you Liou et al. (Liou J, Smith EH, Bateman LM, et al., A model for focal seizure onset, propagation, evolution, and progression, eLife, 2020, 9:e50927).
